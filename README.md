# Emotion-Based Visitor Guidance System

**Author:** Anuroop Arya

## Introduction

This project, named "Emotion-Based Visitor Guidance System," aims to classify facial expressions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system can guide visitors in a museum based on their detected emotions. It leverages deep learning techniques to analyze facial expressions and predict emotions.

## Project Overview

The Emotion-Based Visitor Guidance System processes images to classify emotions into seven categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. The project uses a CNN model trained on a dataset of facial expressions to achieve high accuracy in emotion detection.

## Why I Made This Project
As the topic of my thesis was museums, I envisioned creating a system that could enhance the visitor experience by providing personalized recommendations based on their emotions. This project aligns with my passion for merging architecture with technology to create innovative solutions. By detecting emotions and guiding visitors to exhibits that match their mood, the system aims to make museum visits more engaging and enjoyable.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Keras**: Deep Learning library for neural network implementation.
- **TensorFlow**: Backend for Keras.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.

## Project Approach and Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load and preprocess images from the dataset.
   - Use `ImageDataGenerator` for data augmentation and to generate batches of tensor image data.

2. **CNN Architecture**:
   - Define a sequential model with several convolutional layers, each followed by batch normalization, ReLU activation, max pooling, and dropout for regularization.
   - Use global average pooling before the fully connected layers.
   - Add dense layers with ReLU activation and dropout for further regularization.
   - The final layer uses softmax activation for classification into one of the seven emotion categories.

3. **Compilation and Training**:
   - Compile the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
   - Train the model using the training dataset and validate using the validation dataset.
   - Use callbacks like `ModelCheckpoint`, `EarlyStopping`, and `ReduceLROnPlateau` to monitor performance and adjust learning rates.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance by plotting training and validation loss and accuracy.
   - Visualize the results using Matplotlib.

## Real-World Applications

- **Museums and Exhibitions**: Guide visitors to exhibits based on their detected emotions to enhance their experience.
- **Retail**: Personalize shopping experiences by understanding customer emotions.
- **Healthcare**: Assist in mental health analysis by detecting patient emotions.
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Improve interaction by understanding user emotions.

## Conclusion

The Emotion-Based Visitor Guidance System effectively utilizes deep learning techniques to classify facial expressions, providing valuable insights and applications in various fields.
