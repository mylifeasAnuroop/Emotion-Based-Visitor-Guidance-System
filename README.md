# AI-Powered Emotion Recognition System

**Author:** Anuroop Arya
## Overview

Engineered an advanced emotion recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify facial expressions into seven categories. The system employs state-of-the-art deep learning technologies to enhance user experience through precise emotion detection.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning Libraries**: Keras, TensorFlow
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied techniques to improve model robustness
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Adam, SGD, RMSprop
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Programming Languages**: Python

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- Keras
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install keras tensorflow opencv-python numpy
```
## How It Works
Face Detection: The script uses Haar Cascades to detect faces in real-time video frames.
Emotion Classification: Detected face regions are preprocessed and classified using the pre-trained CNN model.
Display: Emotion labels are overlaid on the video feed, indicating the detected emotion.
